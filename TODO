reference tracking for graphs
runtime instrumentation
where did a graph come from
tuples
lambda types
circular reference finder
low-level debugger with graph step-through
value_or_graph and atom should be merged
compiler error handling with line/char #
dagc source maps
cascading polymorphic functions for typeclasses
proper compiler (i.e., save bytecode)
input nodes shouldn't have required_type, it should be taken from graph type
