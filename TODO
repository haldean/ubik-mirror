reference tracking for graphs
runtime instrumentation
type-based dispatch node
clang format or whatever
where did a graph come from
callback-based scheduler
tuples
don't need value_type, just use tag of child
lambda types
full implementation of graph as value child
        makes sense to wait until tuples are done for testing
