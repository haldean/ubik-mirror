Status: In progress
To do:
    - Recognize non-source-material and strip it.
    - Order-independence between package declaration, blocks, immediate
      expressions and imports.
    - Line number directives to preserve line numbers after stripping
      non-source material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ubik supports literate programming as a first-class language entity.
Ubik has a leg up on many mainstream programming languages when it comes
to literate programming: the ordering of definitions is not significant
in Ubik, so one can order the statements in a module in whatever order
makes a better "narrative". That, combined with the fact that a literate
Ubik file is also valid reStructuredText (reST), means that writing
literate Ubik is both super-easy and barely dissimilar from normal Ubik.

Literate Ubik files have the extension ".ul" or ".rst"; when an input
file has one of these extensions, the Ubik compiler correctly skips the
lines that do not correspond to actual code. Since the file itself is
already valid reST, no processing of the file needs to happen to turn it
into a valid markup file (often called "weaving" in the literate
programming world).

Any code block in a literate Ubik file is considered Ubik source code.
So this:

    ====================================================
    Creating nothing from something
    ====================================================
    A brief exposition on writing a programming language
    ----------------------------------------------------

    Something from nothing is a really cool trick, but nothing from
    something is even cooler. Check out what happens when I do something
    like this::

        : this ^ imp:MaybeThing -> imp:MaybeThing
        = \x -> imp:Nothing

    I did it. I made nothing from something. Check that out. And all I
    needed to do it were these things:

    .. code:: ubik
        . the-void
        + imp

    Which is not dissimilar from this Java code:

    .. code:: java
        package thevoid;
        import imp;

    Or this Go code::

    > package thevoid;
    > import imp;

Becomes this Ubik file:

    : this ^ imp:MaybeThing -> imp:MaybeThing
    = \x -> imp:Nothing
    . the-void
    + imp

Specifically, the following elements are assumed to be Ubik source
material:

    - Unquoted literal blocks of all stripes (any of the
      double-colon-delimited blocks, whether the double colon is on its
      own line or at the end of the previous).
    - Code directives where the name of the programming language is
      explicitly set to "ubik".

If you want code-formatted blocks that aren't treated as Ubik source
material, you can use a code block with the language set to something
else (or just unset entirely). You can also use a quoted literal block,
although you'll end up with the quoting character inside the result.

To avoid a dependency on an entire reST parser, we place a small
constraint on the specific syntax of the directive line. The code
directives must start on their own line and match the following regular
expression:

    \.\. code::[\s]*ubik[\s]*

The code must start on a new line after the directive, and all lines are
taken until a line with no indentation is found again. This is slightly
less flexible than the reST spec usually allows you to be, but it
simplifies the implementation of the weave operation significantly.
